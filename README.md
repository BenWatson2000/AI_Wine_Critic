# Developing an Artificially Intelligent Wine Critic

The determination of a wineâ€™s quality has been ambiguous for quite some time. This study
demonstrates a system built for predicting the quality of new uncritiqued wines with
precision. The purpose of this research is to investigate which features of wine affect its
quality for a winery in Portugal to help optimise production. Using feature importance
ranking, a subset of features was constructed for a wine dataset and was applied to the
training of a Random Forests machine learning model. The amount of alcohol and total
sulphur dioxide was found to be the most important features facilitating to an 87% prediction
accuracy from the model. This project definitively details the effects of these two important
features and their relation to wine quality. The quality proposed by the model was however
generalised to low/high classification, further research should go into a less generalised
predictive model.
